# aDNA_snp_tool
A set of tools for identifying and analyzing phylogenetically informative SNPs across nodes using multiple sequence alignments and read-level data. Designed for ancient DNA and mitochondrial datasets, it enables detection of node-specific SNPs and read-based evaluation of support, deamination, and coverage patterns.
